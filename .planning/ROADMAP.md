# Roadmap: HappyMonitor

## Overview

HappyMonitor transforms the existing WorldMonitor codebase into an optimistic counterpart by adding a "happy" variant at happy.worldmonitor.app. The journey starts with the variant shell and warm visual theme, then builds the content pipeline (curated positive feeds first, ML sentiment filtering second), then delivers panels one cluster at a time -- news feed, map, counters, spotlights, trackers -- finishing with sharing, ambient TV mode, and celebration polish. Every phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability on the live variant.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9

Note: Phases 4, 5, 6, 7 can partially parallelize after Phase 2 completes (they share the variant shell and content pipeline as prerequisites but are otherwise independent).
