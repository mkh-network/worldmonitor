## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Curated feeds before ML filtering -- research confirms sentiment false positives (sarcasm, ironic headlines) make ML-only gating unreliable. Curated sources are primary, ML is supplement.
- [Roadmap]: Only 2 new npm deps needed (papaparse, canvas-confetti) -- everything else uses existing infrastructure.
- [Roadmap]: WHO GHO API may be deprecated -- use World Bank as primary for health indicators to de-risk.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MEDIUM risk: Sentiment threshold (0.85) is a hypothesis -- needs experimentation during Phase 3.
- LOW risk: Positive.News, Future Crunch RSS URLs not verified programmatically -- test at Phase 2 implementation.
- LOW risk: @huggingface/transformers v4 preview dropped Feb 2026 -- do NOT use, stick with existing v2/v3 stable.
