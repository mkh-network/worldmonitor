## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User-submitted good news | Moderation nightmare, quality collapse, spam risk |
| Comments / social features | Destroys dashboard experience, moderation burden |
| Gamification / streaks / points | Undermines authenticity, creates anxiety |
| Push notifications | Notification fatigue, interrupts rather than soothes |
| Personalized / algorithmic feed | Filter bubbles even in positive content, added complexity |
| Premium / paywall | Contradicts freely-accessible mission |
| Excessive animation / particle effects | Kills dashboard credibility (warm, not birthday party) |
